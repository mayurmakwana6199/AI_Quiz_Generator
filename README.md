  - Basic AWT frames and components
  - Layout Managers (FlowLayout, BorderLayout, GridLayout, etc.)
  - Dialogs and Menus
  - Event handling (ActionListener, WindowListener, etc.)
  - Custom graphics and drawing
- Well-organized source code files for each concept
- Suitable for learning, reference, and academic submission

## Project Structure


Each `.java` file demonstrates a specific AWT concept or mini-project. Files are named according to their functionality.

## Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 8 or above** required
- Any IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans) or simple text editor/terminal
