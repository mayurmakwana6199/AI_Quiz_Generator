# AI Quiz Generator (AWT Project Quiz Wizard)

This repository contains a collection of Java GUI applications built using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) as part of the MCA Academic Curriculum. Each demo showcases practical uses of AWT components in building interactive applications.

## Languages & Technologies Used

- **HTML** (~87.1%) – Used primarily for structuring GUI-related content or documentation.  
- **C#** (~10.5%) – Likely used alongside AWT-style logic within the demos or project structure.  
- **CSS** (~2.4%) – Used for styling HTML components.

## Project Overview

- Demonstrates AWT concepts such as frames, panels, layout managers (FlowLayout, BorderLayout, GridLayout, etc.), dialogs, menus, event handling (ActionListener,  WindowListener, etc.), and custom graphics.
- Well-organized source code files for each concept or mini-project.
- Ideal for learning AWT fundamentals or academic reference.

## Project Structure

Each `.java` file illustrates a specific AWT concept or example app (e.g., Button demos, Layout manager examples, event-driven dialogs, etc.). The inclusion of HTML and CSS suggests supporting documentation or UI elements.

## Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 8 or above** required
- Any IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans) or simple text editor/terminal
